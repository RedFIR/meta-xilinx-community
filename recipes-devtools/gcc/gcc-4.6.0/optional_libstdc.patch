gcc-runtime builds libstdc++ separately from gcc-cross-*. Its configure tests using g++ 
will not run correctly since my default the linker will try and link against libstdc++
which shouldn't exist yet. We need an option to disable the automatically added -lstdc++
option whilst leaving -lc, -lgcc and other automatic library dependencies. This patch 
adds such an option which only disables the -lstdc++ linkage.

A "standard" gcc build uses xgcc and hence avoids this. We should ask upstream how to 
do this officially, the likely answer is don't build libstdc++ separately.
